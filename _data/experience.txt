        Working as a self-employed freelancer has it's pros and cons.The 
        ability to choose your next project lets you learn newer, and better,
        ways of coding & learning new technologies and practices. The cons
        are that you no longer work with a team, and often there can be
        unforseen bottlenecks in the process.
        I've spent some considerable time developing a half-dozen alt-coins
        (crypto curriences) C++, blockchain, AWS. As well as WordPress,
        responsive web apps, and GUI design.
