I"6<p>I was hired by Stenek to innovate and develope a business-to-business web solution for their 
wholesale distribution division. The project was a huge success that revolutionized the company. 
Stenek.com handled millions in sales from thousands of businesses in Atlantic Canada. All 
infrastructure (Web, Email, Data, and Application Servers) was in house, and my responsibility.</p>

<p>Stenek had an office supply retail division, and a print/copy centre division as well. I managed,
and worked at the printing division during my time at Stenek Corporation.</p>
