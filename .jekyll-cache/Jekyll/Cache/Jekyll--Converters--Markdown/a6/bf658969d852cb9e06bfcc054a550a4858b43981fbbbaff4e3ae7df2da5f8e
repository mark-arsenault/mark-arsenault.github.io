I"1<p>I was hired by Stenek to innovate and build a B2B web solution
for their wholesale distribution division. The project was a huge
undertaking, and even bigger success. Stenek.com had millions in sales 
from thousands of businesses in Atlantic Canada. We had all our servers 
(web,email,data,application) in house, and gave our customer and vendor
accounts the ability to completely manage their accounts from online.</p>

<p>Stenek had a retail, and print/copy centre division as well. I managed,
and worked at the printing divison during this time also.</p>
