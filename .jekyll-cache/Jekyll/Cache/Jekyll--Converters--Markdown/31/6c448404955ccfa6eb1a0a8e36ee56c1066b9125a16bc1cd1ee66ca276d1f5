I"'<p>I was hired by Stenek Co. to innovate &amp; build a B2B web solution
for their wholesale distribution division. The project was a huge
success. Stenek.com had millions in sales from thousands of businesses
in Atlantic Canada. We had all our servers (web,email,data,application)
in house, and gave our customer, and vendor accounts, the ability
to manage their accounts, and have access to real-time inventory info.
Stenek had a retail, and print/copy centre division as well. I managed
and worked at the printing divison during this time also.</p>
